This is qiying's home on the web! 

I am a first-year PhD student at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by [Prof. Jingjing Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1201.htm) (aka JJ).

Periodically, I'll post blogs about what I've learned about AI or math. Welcome discussions!
