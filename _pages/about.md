I am a second-year PhD student at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, advised by Prof.[ Jingjing Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1194.htm) (aka JJ) and [Prof. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io).

My research interest lies in self-supervised learning, multimodal large foundation models.

## Research Persuit

I am devoting all myself to pursue the birth of safe *super intelligence*. Only after this goal is achieved can I truly retire :).

Long way to go.

~~*big convergence of language, vision and multimodal learning*, to help machines comprehensively understand the fanscinating world, like human. (also well known as, **AGI**)~~
