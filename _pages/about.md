I am a first-year PhD student at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by Prof.[ Jingjing Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1201.htm) (aka JJ) and [Prof. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io). I also closely collaborate with Prof.[Yang Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1204.htm) and Prof.[Yang Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1198.htm).

My research interest lies in self-supervised learning, multimodal large foundation models.

Periodically, I'll post blogs about what I've learned about <font color='red'>AI or math</font>. Welcome discussions!

## Research Persuit

I am devoting all myself to pursue a *big convergence of language, vision and multimodal learning*, to help machines comprehensively understand the fanscinating world, like human.
