I am a second-year PhD student at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Jingjing Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1194.htm) (aka JJ) and [Prof. Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io).

My research interest lies in self-supervised learning, multimodal large foundation models.

I love coding and playing with complicated source code, love the same feeling as [Greg Brockman](https://x.com/gdb/status/1728308513888170134?s=20):

```
that feeling when you finally understand a piece of previously inscrutable code
```

I am interested in physics and in approximating the truth of our universe.

## Research Persuit

I am devoting all myself to pursue the birth of safe *super intelligence*. Only after this goal is achieved can I truly retire :).

Long way to go.

~~*big convergence of language, vision and multimodal learning*, to help machines comprehensively understand the fanscinating world, like human. (also well known as, **AGI**)~~

## ðŸš€ News

- `Dec, 23`: We are thrilled to announce [Emu2](https://baaivision.github.io/emu2/), the most capable open-weight vision-language multimodal model, which can both understand and draw images. Try the [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BAAI/Emu2)!

## Internship

2023.01 -- Now, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), mentored by [Yue Cao](http://yue-cao.me), [Quan Sun](https://github.com/Quan-Sun) and [Xinlong Wang](https://www.xloong.wang).

## Inspirational Persons

Below are some persons from around the world whom I **greatly admire**:

[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), [Mu Li](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~muli/index.html): They have had a profound impact on me with their incredible open-source spirit.

Ilya Sutskever, Sam Altman

Greg Brockman: President of OpenAI. It is amazing that he still writes low-level code at such a high-level position.

Edward Witten: He revolutionized my understanding of the physical world surrounding me.
